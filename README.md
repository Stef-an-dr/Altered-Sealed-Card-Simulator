There are 2 steps to using this:

1) Generating the cards - This script generates the card codes unique to every card that can be found in a pack. You can either run it by downloading/cloning the script and running it locally or making a copy of the 
   [following colab file](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zpH0_yhyDBoveKKxLnguVMyRZ6OpMtPQ?usp=sharing). Change the numbers in the packs variable for each pack to change how many of each it will open.

2) Using/Viewing the cards - The codes are not really useful for a regular player on their own, so I recommend using [altered db](https://altered-db.com/) for the collection or grid view features and [this simulator](https://exalts-table.com/play) for playing.

If you have any functionality you would like to add, feel free to either fork a new project or make a PR for this one. I am trying to add new features, but there is no set timeline on them - this was initially meant to be a one afternoon project.
